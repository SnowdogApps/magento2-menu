**Magento 2 Menu** by [Snowdog](https://snow.dog) is a **powerful menu configurator** that empowers online merchants to create advanced menus, enhancing their customers' shopping experience and improving SEO. 
This module serves as a feature-rich replacement for the category-based top navigation found in Magento and Adobe Commerce. However, it offers much more versatility by enabling the creation of menus for various purposes and store views.
